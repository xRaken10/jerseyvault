/**
 * Rewrites a Yupoo image URL to go through our proxy route.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NECESSARY:
 * photo.yupoo.com enforces a Referer-based hotlink protection.
 * It returns HTTP 567 (a custom rejection code) for any request
 * whose Referer header doesn't belong to a whitelisted set of domains.
 *
 * Whitelisted by Yupoo: http://localhost (any port), https://*.x.yupoo.com
 * Blocked by Yupoo: empty Referer, any external production domain.
 *
 * STRATEGY:
 * - In development (Vite dev server): Vite's proxy rewrites /img-proxy/* to
 *   photo.yupoo.com/* and injects `Referer: https://x.yupoo.com/` on the
 *   server-to-server request. The browser sees localhost as the origin, which
 *   also works, but the proxy-injected Referer is what matters in production.
 *
 * - In production: The hosting platform (Vercel/Netlify) must configure an
 *   equivalent rewrite rule. See /vercel.json or /netlify.toml for the config.
 *   Without it, images will fail in production. This is a deployment concern,
 *   not a code concern — the proxy URL format is identical in both environments.
 *
 * USAGE: Always use this function when building <img src>. Never use raw Yupoo URLs.
